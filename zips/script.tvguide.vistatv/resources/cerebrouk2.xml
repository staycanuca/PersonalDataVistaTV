    <desc lang="en">The story of what really happened on June 1, 2009, when Air France Flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 228 passengers and crew.

The team battles the rain, wind and dangerously unstable trackways, but the combination of sheer effort and hi-tech kit enables the experts to access the heart of an old mine(n)</desc>

The victim's family are convinced it was the work of a ghost said to haunt the plantation, but Humphrey is determined to find a more rational explanation. Meanwhile, Fidel has moved on, leaving Officer Dwayne Myers holding the fort - and while he is struggling to cope, the last thing he needs is the Commissioner stepping in to help.
